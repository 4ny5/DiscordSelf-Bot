# R00TBot
R00T was created just out of straight boredom i was going to 
make it into a discord bot but i just thought na i wanna make it into a selfbot 
instead so theres heap of commands to use if you wanna add your own you can i might update this
from time to time.

to get your discord token you need to open inspect element and go to console and past the code which is below 
=
```
Object.values(webpackJsonp.push([[],{['']:(_,e,r)=>{e.cache=r.c}},[['']]]).cache)
.find(m=>m.exports&&m.exports.default&&m.exports.default.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
```

after you have your token go to the file named prviate.json and past your token where it says "TokenHere" then you should be all good
=

ps all commands are made by George and thats me
Have fun :)
