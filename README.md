# R00TBot
R00T was created just out of straight boredom i was going to 
make it into a discord bot but i just thought na i wanna make it into a selfbot 
instead so theres heap of commands to use if you wanna add your own commands to it you're more and welcome to.

to get your token you would needa open inspect and go to console and past this code 

Object.values(webpackJsonp.push([[],{['']:(_,e,r)=>{e.cache=r.c}},[['']]]).cache)
.find(m=>m.exports&&m.exports.default&&m.exports.default.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()


Have fun :)
