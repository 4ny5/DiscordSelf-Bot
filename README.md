# R00TBot
R00T was created just out of straight boredom i was going to 
make it into a discord bot but i just thought na i wanna make it into a selfbot 
instead so theres heap of commands to use.

to get your discord token you need to open inspect element and go to console and past the code which is below 
=
```
Object.values(webpackJsonp.push([[],{['']:(_,e,r)=>{e.cache=r.c}},[['']]]).cache)
.find(m=>m.exports&&m.exports.default&&m.exports.default.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
```

Have fun :)
